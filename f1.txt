USING PRECODE AND SYNTAXHIGHLIGHTER
PreCode is Anthony Bouch's Windows Live Writer plugin. SyntaxHighlighter is Alex Gorbatchev's JavaScript (that's client-side) syntax highlighter. SyntaxHighlighter highlights your code locally using <pre> blogs that are marked for specific languages. You include "brushes" for just the langugaes you care about. This is the combination that I currently use.

SyntaxHighlighter is definitely the client-side highlighter of choice, but there are others you might also check out including:

Chili Highlighter - Hosted on Google Code
Google Code Prettify - This is the code highlighter that Google themselves use on Google Code. It doesn't require you to specify the language. It works on most C-style languages, works iffy on Ruby, PHP and VB, and needs extensions for LISP and F# and others.
NOTE: Make sure whatever one you pick that you're cool with the OSS license for your library of choice.

From within Live Writer you click "Insert PreCode Snippet" and paste your snippet in. It has a number of nice options. I use HTML encode and "replace line endings with <br/> which is required for use in DasBlog for historical reasons. It also has a number of SyntaxHighlighter specific options for doing line-highlights or turning the toolbar on and off.

using System;
 
namespace WindowsGame1
{
#if WINDOWS || XBOX
    static class Program
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The main entry point for the application.
        /// </summary>
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (Game1 game = new Game1())
            {
                game.Run();
            }
        }
    }
#endif
}
